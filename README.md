# Software Architecture: A Pragmatic Guide

This repository is a curated collection of software architecture and design patterns. It's built as a practical handbook for engineers who design, build, and maintain robust, scalable, and resilient systems.

The focus here is not on abstract theory, but on understanding the core principles, trade-offs, and ideal use cases for each pattern.

## üèõÔ∏è Architectural Patterns

Below is a growing list of architectural patterns. Each one includes a detailed breakdown, diagrams, and practical considerations.

### Foundational Patterns
* [Model-View-Controller (MVC)](./Model-View-Controller/README.md) - *A pattern for separating user interface concerns from business logic.*
* Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) - *(Coming Soon)*
* Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) - *(Coming Soon)*

### Distributed Systems & Microservices
* Microservices Architecture - *(Coming Soon)*
* Event-Driven Architecture - *(Coming Soon)*
* CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) - *(Coming Soon)*
* API Gateway - *(Coming Soon)*

### Data Patterns
* Repository Pattern - *(Coming Soon)*
* Unit of Work - *(Coming Soon)*

## Guiding Philosophy

1.  **No Silver Bullets:** Every pattern has trade-offs. We will always discuss both the advantages and the disadvantages to enable informed decisions.
2.  **Context is Key:** The "best" architecture depends entirely on the problem you are trying to solve. The goal here is to equip you with the knowledge to choose the right tool for the job.
3.  **Clarity Over Complexity:** Code examples will be simple and focused, designed to illustrate the pattern's structure, not to build a production-ready application.
